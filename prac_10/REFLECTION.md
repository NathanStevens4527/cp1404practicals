#Reflection
##Estimates
I found most of my estimates to be inaccurate over the course of my prac work.
I often under estimated the length of time that certain tasks would take me 
especially when doing class oriented programs.
##Code Reviews
Code reviews were a useful practice as they allowed me to learn from other peoples
code by seeing different solutions than mine. The same principle also applied when
recieving code reviews as it is helpful to receive feedback from a different persons
perspective.
##practical tasks
I found the practical tasks were generally good at making me use the principles and
coding examples used in the lecture materials. They were also good for teaching things
that would be used in assignments on a per case basis that would then need to be combined
later.
